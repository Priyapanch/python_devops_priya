To transform COBOL code to Python using **Amazon Q (Developer Assistant)**, you can set up a **Q Developer Pipeline** focused on **code transformation (modernization)**. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of how you'd do this in the **Amazon Q Developer (code transformation)** setup:

---

### **Step-by-Step: Amazon Q Pipeline to Transform COBOL to Python**

---

#### **1. Prerequisites**
- Amazon Q Developer Assistant enabled in your AWS environment.
- Source code repository with COBOL code (e.g., in AWS CodeCommit or GitHub).
- Target environment set up for Python (e.g., AWS Lambda, EC2, or containerized).
- AWS CodeCatalyst project or CI/CD tools like CodePipeline if integrating further.

---

#### **2. Create a New Amazon Q Code Transformation Project**
Amazon Q allows creating transformation projects for legacy application modernization.

- Go to **Amazon Q Developer Console**.
- Click **"Create Project"**.
- Choose **“Code Transformation”**.
- Select **“COBOL to Python”** as your transformation type.

---

#### **3. Connect Your Source Repository**
- Select or connect your **CodeCommit**, **GitHub**, or **Bitbucket** repository containing COBOL code.
- Q Developer will automatically analyze the repo and detect COBOL programs.

---

#### **4. Configure Transformation Settings**
- **Language Target**: Python 3.11+  
- **Execution Target** (optional): Lambda, EC2, or container.
- **Output Format**: Choose either raw Python code or Flask-based app if it's API-based.
- You can specify preferences like:
  - Modularization level (e.g., one file per COBOL program).
  - Test stub generation.
  - Logging and tracing hooks.

---

#### **5. Review and Start Transformation**
- Q shows a **mapping view** of COBOL programs, functions, variables.
- It provides **previews** of how certain parts will be converted to Python (including data structures like `01-level` records to Python classes/dicts).
- Click **“Transform Code”**.

---

#### **6. Review Transformed Code**
- Q gives a side-by-side comparison of original COBOL and generated Python code.
- Provides comments and rationale for each transformation.
- Supports editing before committing to your repo.

---

#### **7. Generate Unit Tests (Optional)**
- You can ask Q to generate **pytest-based** unit tests based on COBOL test cases or job control logic.

---

#### **8. Commit to Target Repository**
- Transformed Python code is committed to your selected branch or new repo.
- You can now integrate it with CI/CD pipelines or serverless infrastructure.

```
+----------------------+       +----------------------+       +---------------------+
|  COBOL Source (Repo) | --->  | Amazon Q Code Modern | --->  | Python Code Output  |
+----------------------+       +----------------------+       +---------------------+
       (GitHub,                 | - Analyze COBOL     |        | - Python modules    |
        CodeCommit)             | - Map to Python     |        | - Unit tests        |
                                | - Test scaffolds     |       | - CI-ready code     |
                                +----------------------+       +---------------------+
```

### **Post Transformation: Integrate CI/CD**

If you want to build, test, and deploy your Python code:

- Use **AWS CodeBuild** to build and test.
- Use **AWS CodePipeline** or **GitHub Actions** to deploy to:
  - AWS Lambda
  - AWS Fargate
  - EC2 or container services

### Need More?
I can generate a sample COBOL to Python conversion using Q-like logic or give you Terraform/CDK to automate the pipeline setup if needed.

Would you like an actual code example (COBOL snippet and transformed Python)?
